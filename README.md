Introduction

This is a JavaScript code for a simple social media-like application that allows a user to like and comment on posts. This document serves as a guide for anyone interested in understanding how the code works.

Usage

To use the code, simply copy and paste it into a JavaScript file and include it in your HTML document. The code can be customized to suit your specific needs.

Code Explanation

The code is composed of four functions, each serving a specific purpose, and an event listener to capture the click event on the heart and comment icons to change their colors


Function 1: handlePost

This function handles the event when the user clicks on the heart icon. It filters through an array of posts to find the post that matches the clicked username, updates the likes count, and toggles the isLiked property. Finally, it calls the render function to update the UI.

Function 2: handleComment

This function handles the event when the user clicks on the comment icon. It filters through an array of posts to find the post that matches the clicked username and toggles the isComment property. Finally, it calls the render function to update the UI.

Function 3: getFeeds

This function generates the HTML markup for each post and returns it as a string. It includes user profile, user post, viewers' icon, likes count, and the comment section.

Function 4: render

This function updates the UI by inserting the HTML generated by the getFeeds function into the DOM element with the id 'feed'.
Event Listener

This listens for a click event on the heart and comment icons. If clicked, it calls the corresponding function to handle the event.

Conclusion

This code is a simple implementation of a social media-like application. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications or as a learning tool for understanding JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation.
